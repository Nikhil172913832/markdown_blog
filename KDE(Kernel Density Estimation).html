<p>Lets say you have a dataset which contains the set of weights of people in a class and now you have to see the distribution of weights now what you can do is make a histogram but you want a more continuous visualisation so the way to achieve this would we using KDE now how it works is simple lets say you have a data point so the probability of having people of weight close to that point is high and lets say it follows some distribution lets say normal that would be our kernel now let say you wanna find what is the likely hood of a specific weight person to be in that class so you can simply take the average of the probabilities that come from the kernel of each data point to get the estimated probability for that point now how wide is the distribution is spread is represented by bandwidth and this is a more important feature in determining whether your kde is correct or not than the kernel itself as if you have a high bandwidth the plot might come a little too smooth and if its two low you would have a rough curve which preserves the local structure of data points with peaks on the points themselves and drop in the vicinity so you want an optimal bandwidth for this now the most popular way to achieve this would be using cross validation and what you do in this basically you take a range of values for your bandwidth and leave some points out and make the kde now when you introduce those points again you see how volatile your curve gets that means how much will it change by introduction of a few points if it changes drastically(it's not just about change, but how systematic the change is. If the curve changes unpredictably or overfits when adding points, the bandwidth is likely too low. If it's too smooth and insensitive to changes, it might be too high.) that means your bandwidth is not appropriate. other way to achieve this might be through visual inspection.</p></body>
