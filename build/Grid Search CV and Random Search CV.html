<body><p>This is a technique for hyper-parameters tuning in the grid one it goes over all the possible combinations of the hyper-parameters so that makes it computationally very expensive as the search space grows exponentially with the number of hyper-parameters. The random one picks random combination of the hyperparameters and these combinations are not a shot in the dark instead we define the distributions for all the parameters like log scale for learning rate, discrete distributions for categorical and uniform for continuous now there is a better way to random search is using [[Bayesian optimization]] which chooses results based on the previous results. </p></body>
