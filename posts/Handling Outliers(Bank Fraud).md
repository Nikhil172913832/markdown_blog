1. If there are significantly more number of outliers for fraud than the non fraud cases then the feature holds importance.
2. If there are significantly more number of outliers for non-fraud than the fraud cases then its just noise and clipping might help remove these extreme cases as they do not really hold much info as we are more interested in understanding fraud patterns.
3. If they are comparable then the data might be skewed it likely needs log transformation.
