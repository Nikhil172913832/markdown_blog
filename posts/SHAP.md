SHAP values improve upon PDP by addressing two major issues:

1. **PDP creates unrealistic samples** because it assumes feature independence. It fixes all other features and varies the target feature, leading to impossible data points when features are correlated.
2. **PDP suffers from isolation effects**—it doesn’t account for how a feature interacts with others, so its effect may be exaggerated or underestimated.

SHAP solves these problems by changing **how hypothetical data points are created**:

- Instead of varying only one feature while keeping others fixed, SHAP takes a **random permutation of features**.
- Given a permutation, all features **to the right** of the target feature (including the target itself) are replaced with values from a reference dataset (real samples).
- The difference between model predictions for these new data points and their counterparts **with and without the target feature** allows SHAP to fairly compute the **marginal contribution** of the feature.

This method respects feature dependencies, reducing the risk of impossible samples and mitigating the isolation effect.
