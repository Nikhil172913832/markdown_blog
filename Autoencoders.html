<p>An auto-encoder is a type of neural network that tries to learn an approximation to the identity function using back-propagation. So, basically it is going to map a set of unlabelled training inputs to a hidden state using deterministic mapping y = s(W * x + b) where s can be any non linear function </p></body>
